🔹 🧩 Module 1: Browser Automation + Raw Scraper
Status: ✅ Done

✔️ Built using Playwright (Python) for headless browser control.

✔️ Implemented launch_browser_and_scrape_opportunities() in browser_driver.py.

✔️ Script navigates to a specified Gowin URL and extracts:

title

description

link

✔️ Selector-based scraping with error handling, screenshots on failure.

✔️ Successfully tested end-to-end from VS Code in virtual environment.

✅ Output returned: list of dicts (opportunities).

🔹 🧩 Module 2: Conditional Filtering Engine
Status: ✅ Logic shared & to be implemented

📦 Built as opportunity_parser.py

✔️ Accepts raw data (from the scraper)

✔️ Loads external filters.json for logic (keyword-based logic, tag fit levels)

✔️ Applies logic:

Best Fit → strict match with core keywords

Moderate → partial match with related tech

Ignore → eliminate noisy domains like fashion/retail

✔️ Returns only relevant structured opportunities with a new "fit" tag. 

Module 3: Data Structurer & Exporter
Structure final results to structured_output.csv or .json

Add timestamping, source tagging, etc.

🔸 Module 4: Email Dispatch
Use SMTP with .env credentials

Send daily filtered reports to respective POCs

Attach opportunity links and metadata

🔸 Module 5: Trigger Engine / Scheduler
Auto-trigger the scraper every day (9-hour window)

Use schedule, cron, or Task Scheduler (on Windows)

🔸 Module 6: Logging + Error Tracking
Create logs/run_log_<date>.log

Track start time, scrape count, success/failure, exceptions
